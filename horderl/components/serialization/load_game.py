class LoadGame(EnergyActor):
    """
    Component that handles loading a saved game state from disk.

    LoadGame inherits from EnergyActor to integrate with the game's energy system,
    allowing load operations to be scheduled within the turn-based flow of the game.
    When activated, it deserializes the game state from a specified file and
    reconstructs all game objects through the component manager.

    The component includes performance tracking to monitor load times, which is
    useful for optimization and debugging. It also provides user feedback through
    the scene messaging system upon completion.

    Attributes:
        energy_cost (int): The energy cost of performing the load action.
                           Set to INSTANT by default to execute immediately.
        file_name (str): Path to the save file that should be loaded.

        This method is called by the energy system when this component's turn
        arrives in the action queue. It removes itself from the component manager
        to prevent state corruption and then calls load_world to perform the
        actual deserialization.

            scene: The active game scene containing the component manager and

        1. It records the start time for performance tracking
