Crops Module.

This module handles crop entities in the game, which are valuable resources that farmers
grow and players must protect from hordelings. Crops have monetary value and can be
harvested at the end of the season for gold.

Crops are part of the agricultural system and represent one of the main economic
elements that players need to protect to succeed.
