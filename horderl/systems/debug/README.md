# Debug Systems

This directory owns debug-focused systems that support development tooling.
These systems are responsible for temporary gameplay helpers such as debug
painter tools and other non-player workflows.

## Responsibilities
- Provide systems for debug-only interactions and placement helpers.
- Keep debug tooling logic isolated from core gameplay systems.

## Feature Verticals
- Painter tools for spawning entities during debugging sessions.
